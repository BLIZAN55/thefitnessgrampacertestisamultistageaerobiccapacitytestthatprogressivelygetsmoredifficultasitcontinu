        <p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the
            villas
            are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day
            by
            8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight
            hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of
            stretches
            before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without
            any
            fatigue or stress in the morning.</p>
